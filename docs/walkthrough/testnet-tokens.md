# Getting testnet tokens

In order to get testnet tokens, you first need to create an address. Please see [the tutorial](/walkthrough/creating-addresses) describing several available ways to do so.

When you have an address, you'll need some tokens to operate in the network.

There are three easy ways of getting tokens on testnet:

1. *Use our token tap* Go here — https://explore-testnet.fetch.ai/tokentap — paste the Address in and press the DISPENSE button. Wait 30-60 seconds and voila, you'll have 10-500 test-FET just like that. Using our above example, you can send the above “free for all” account tokens by pasting `2uGQSyM56XfkaFeoyYib2dt4rvFwVZ6if5JREZd54d1sNehEQ5` into the address box.
2. *Transfer tokens from another account you have!* It's easy, you can use Pocketbook and it takes no time at all. Just use the `pocketbook -n testnet transfer destination_account_name AMOUNT source_account_name` syntax and you're done.
3. *Ask in the [Fetch developer slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fetch-ai/shared_invite/enQtNDI2MDYwMjE3OTQwLWY0ZjAyYjM0NGQzNWRhNDMxMzdjYmVhYTE3NDNhNTAyMTE0YWRkY2VmOWRmMGQ3ODM1N2NjOWUwNDExM2U3YjY)*. We have tons, and we're happy to send large amounts if you need them for specific contracts or tests. *Don't be shy*, we want you to get stuff done. It may take a day or two, but we'll do our best to make it quick.

That's it for part 1, in which we've learned how to create addresses that work on testnet and mainnet, and how to get tokens for them.

In part 2, we'll be doing transactions in code and transactions using pocketbook to get you moving things around easily.
