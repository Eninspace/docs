# *Part 0: Introduction*

Welcome to the Fetch “How to use Fetch” developer walk-through. This is a growing, multi-part series of walk-throughs that will guide you from your first testnet wallet and token transfer to deploying your own [agents](https://docs.fetch.ai/aea/) and [smart contracts](https://docs.fetch.ai/smart-contracts/smart-contract-intro/) locally, on testnet or on the Fetch mainnet.

Currently, it consists of the following parts:

*Creating addresses and getting testnet tokens*, in which you’ll learn how to use the various tools and Python to create testnet (or mainnet) addresses and get tokens. 
*Transfers and balances*, in which you’ll learn different ways of seeing token balances and how to transfer tokens from one place to another.
*Deploying and interacting with smart contracts on Fetch*, where you’ll deploy your own token contract to Fetch and interact with it.

All the tutorials are designed to work on testnet and mainnet where applicable. In all cases, we introduce the tools we have and use the various APIs Fetch supports (such as the [Python API](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-api-py) and [JavaScript API](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-api-javascript)) to interact with the ledger. 

We would welcome feedback on the walk-throughs, including anything that you feel is missing, not explained in enough detail or could be improved.
