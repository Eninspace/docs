<h1>Debugging tips and tricks</h1>

Use `printLn(toString(...))` to query variables on the command line and in the `etch` playground.

  <p>In a live environment, the `etch` compiler will strip out `printLn()` statements.</p>

## Compiling

[!comment]: <> (Todo: fill out with examples as we go along.)

Our compiler is very strict. It will complain about:

-   Unknown and unsupported symbols, operators, and indexes.
-   Lack of types for variables and parameters.
-   Assigning `null` to primitive types.
-   Incorrect, incompatible, and uninferrable types in statements and functions.
-   Duplicate variables, parameters, and functions.
-   Incomparable types in boolean tests.
-   Unmatched and unexpected beginnings, middles, and endings in selections, iterations, statements, and blocks.
-   Incorrectly formed statements.
-   Incorrect amount, or lack of, operands in boolean tests.
-   `break` and `continue` statements outside `while` or `for` loops.
-   Non-functions, unmatched functions, and functions that do not return a value.
-   Local function definitions.
-   Returning `null` or no value from functions.
-   Attempts to construct primitives and unmatched constructors.
-   Mismatches between type and instance functions.
-   Member access support issues with dot operator.
-   `while`, `for`, `if`, `var`, `return`, `break`, `continue`, variables, and expressions declared at topmost scope.

## System arguments

`System.Argc()` and `System.Argv()` give access to compiler argument count and values. The following code prints the number of compiler arguments, then lists their values.

```c++
function main()

  var message : String;

  printLn("System args: " + toString(System.Argc()));

  // print the argument values
  for(i in 0:System.Argc())
    message = toString(i) + " = " + System.Argv(i);
    printLn(message);
  endfor

endfunction
```

Running the code from the command line with zero flags `--` sends arguments to the `etch` executable.

For example, run the code snippet above with zero flags `--` and an example argument `hello` like this:

`./etch sysargs-examples.etch -- hello`

You should see the following output:

```c++
 F E â•±     etch v0.1.0-30-g557389e0
   T C     Copyright 2018-2019 (c) Fetch AI Ltd.
     H

System args: 2
0 = ./etch
1 = hello
```

`etch` features like this are useful for experimentation and debugging in a development environment. For example, the system arguments can load machine learning training data into a script.

For smart contracts, there are flags, such as `-data`, which do specific things. We explain coding, compiling, contract flags, and all about `etch` smart contracts <a href="../.././smart-contracts/smart-contract-intro/" target=_blank> here</a>.
