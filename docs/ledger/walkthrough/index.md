# Introduction

Welcome to the Fetch.ai ledger walkthrough, which will introduce you to all the steps necessary to use and develop against the ledger, from creating your first address and making a token transfer, to deploying your own smart contracts.

All the tutorials are designed to work on testnet and mainnet where applicable. In all cases, we introduce the tools we have and use the various APIs Fetch supports (such as the [Python API](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-api-py) and [JavaScript API](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-api-javascript)) to interact with the ledger. 

We would welcome feedback on these walkthroughs, including anything that you feel is missing, not explained in enough detail or could be improved. If you have any suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fetchai/docs/issues/new) in our repository.
