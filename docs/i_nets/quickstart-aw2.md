## Introduction: Agent World 2 (AW-2) - part 2, "My first own agent"

Agent World 2 (AW-2) is the second part of our agent-themed incentivised testnet. During this part, It allows anyone with FET tokens to gain additional FET by building agents to represent **mobility** and **climate/weather** related agents in key cities around the world, such as Berlin, London, San Francisco and Shanghai. The world is full of web based APIs for collecting this data, and the Agent Framework supports HTTP connections to these. More documentation and details will follow.
