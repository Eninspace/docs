## Introduction: Beacon World 1 (BW-1) - part 1, Getting started with Staking and Governance

Beacon-world 1 (BW-1) is the second stage of our program for testing the Fetch.ai blockchain and for preparing our community for the launch of our v2.0 main-net. The goal of BW-1 is to reward users and potential validators for gaining experience with the software ecosystem around the main-network. These tasks don't require any technical knowledge or programming experience; all you need is an interest in Fetch.ai and a willingness to help shape its future direction.

## Rewards

The following table shows the incentive rewards on offer.

Action             | Test FET (on Agent World)  | FET (on Ethereum mainnet) | Cap (first come first serve)
------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------
Steps 1 - x below  | 100                        | 100                       | 800
Tweet              | 0                          | 50                        | 800


A key responsibility of validators, developers and consumers is that they take part in decisions on the future directions of the project. The way that these decisions are made is known as governance and is a key element of decentralised networks. The Fetch.ai ledger uses a simple governance mechanism that is inspired by the first [blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-coders-confront-an-old-quandary-how-to-upgrade-an-entire-network), where a majority of miners have to make a decision on whether to perform a specific software upgrade to the network. 

## How to qualify for incentive rewards?

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>You must complete <a href="../quickstart-aw1">AW-1</a> before continuing! While not striclty necessary we also encourage people who have not already done so to try out the other AW-* challenges</p>
</div>

To earn the reward, users must complete the following tasks, which are designed to familiarise them with the tools used for sending transactions, delegating stake and voting on governance proposals:

1. Obtain a working copy of the ledger v0.2.x software either by using one of the provided [docker images](/#) or by [checking out and building](#/) one from source.

2. Import your AW-1 private key from into the `fetchcli` following these [instructions](/ledger_v2/cli-keys/#importing-a-private-key-generated-from-the-agent-framework))

3. Delegate some of your stake to the one of the existing validators that are running following these [instructions](/ledger_v2/governance/#stake-delegation)

The full list of validators can be found [on the block explorer](https://explore-agentworld.prod.fetch-ai.com/validators). For convience the operator addresses are summarised below:

| Validator | Operator Address |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Bond      | fetchvaloper1cct4fhhksplu9m9wjljuthjqhjj93z0s97p3g7 |
| Bourne    | fetchvaloper12xd8rgp2u0cwp8lnj2ndulpzad3y9m9f2r8lsx |
| Hunt      | fetchvaloper1vf5wsxjkmjk4uv3nm2zjplw0y2f96rsjw8k7gv |
| Powers    | fetchvaloper108hhutnylgz09acca2ljde8dp6huhsu67hn8v7 |

4. Vote on at least one governance proposal following these [instructions](/ledger_v2/governance/#voting-on-a-proposal)

During this event we will be discussing the proposals on our discord channel  <a href="https://discord.gg/UDzpBFa" target="_blank">here</a>.

This allows you to ask questions throughout BW-1 and engage with the Fetch.ai developers.

From this point, there are casual and technical tracks for interacting with the BW-1 test-net. We recommend that developers or anyone with an interest in running a validator node follow the technical track while non-technical users should follow the casual track. Please note that a ledger nano hardware wallet is required for the casual track. It's possible to follow the steps in both tracks but each Ethereum staking address will only receive one reward.
 

**Casual** 

1. Install the Cosmos app on your ledger nano. 

2. 

**Developer**

3.
