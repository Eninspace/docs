## Introduction: Beacon World 1 (BW-1) - part 1, Getting started with Staking and Governance

Beacon-world 1 (BW-1) is the first stage of our program for testing the Fetch.ai blockchain and for preparing our community for the launch of our v2.0 main-net. The goal of BW-1 is to reward users and potential validators for gaining experience with the software ecosystem around the main-network. These tasks don't require any technical knowledge or programming experience; all you need is an interest in Fetch.ai and a willingness to help shape its future direction.

## Rewards

The following table shows the incentive rewards on offer.

Action             | Test FET (on Beacon World)  | FET (on Ethereum mainnet) | Cap (first come first serve)
------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------
Steps 1 - x below  | 100                        | 100                       | 800
Tweet              | 0                          | 50                        | 800


A key responsibility of validators, developers and consumers is that they take part in decisions on the future directions of the project. The way that these decisions are made is known as governance and is a key element of decentralised networks. The Fetch.ai ledger uses a simple governance mechanism that is inspired by the first [blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-coders-confront-an-old-quandary-how-to-upgrade-an-entire-network), where a majority of miners have to make a decision on whether to perform a specific software upgrade to the network. 

To earn the reward, users must complete the following three tasks, which are designed to familiarise them with the tools used for sending transactions, delegating stake and voting on governance proposals:

1. Create a test-net address and link this to their Ethereum staking address. 

2. Send a transaction on the test-net. 

3. Delegate stake to one of the validators on the test-net. 

4. Vote on at least one governance proposal.

   From this point, there are casual and technical tracks for interacting with the BW-1 test-net. We recommend that developers or anyone with an interest in running a validator node follow the technical track while non-technical users should follow the casual track. Please note that a ledger nano hardware wallet is required for the casual track. It's possible to follow the steps in both tracks but each Ethereum staking address will only receive one reward.
