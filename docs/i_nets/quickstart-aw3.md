## Introduction: Agent World 3 (AW-3) - part 3, "Many agents interacting"

Agent World 3 (AW-3) is the third part of our agent-themed incentivised testnet. During this part, It allows anyone with FET tokens to gain additional FET by re-using and adapting agents from AW-2 in order to further grow the useful population of agents. This is open to a broader range of developers, including those just starting out: it's __always__ easier to modify an existing agent than create a new one, and AW-3 makes available all the agents from AW-2 for all to work with via the agent registry.
